  abstract    = {Wave propagation in the heart tube is key to establishing an early pumping mechanism, as explained by impedance pump theory in zebrafish. Though initially proposed for embryonic blood circulation, the role of impedance-like behaviour in the mature cardiovascular system remains unclear. This study focuses on the understudied physiological mechanism of longitudinal displacement in the adult aorta caused by the long-axis motion of the heart. Using magnetic resonance imaging on 159 individuals, we compared aortic displacement profiles between a control group and those with heart failure, revealing a significant difference in aortic stretch between the two groups. Building on this clinical evidence, we conducted in vitro experiments to isolate the effects of longitudinal aortic wave pumping by eliminating the pumping action of the heart. We identified three biomechanical properties of stretch-related longitudinal wave pumping that exhibit characteristics like impedance pump: (i) a nonlinear flow–frequency relationship, (ii) bidirectional flow, and (iii) the potential for both positive and negative flow at a fixed frequency, contingent upon the aorta’s wave speed dictating the wave state. Our results demonstrate for the first time that this mechanism generates a significant flow, potentially providing a supplementary pumping mechanism for the heart.},

  author      = {Aghilinejad, Arian and Amlani, Faisal and Gharib, Morteza},
  abstract    = {The human heart pumps in a pulsatile fashion that generates pressure and flow waves in the cardiovascular system. These waves propagate and reflect through a fractal tree network composed of fluid-filled compliant tubes. The resulting complex pressure and flow waves create a pulsatile workload (an important contributor to the pumping efficiency of the heart). Although such load has been shown to be dependent on inflow wave frequency, the fundamental relationship between power and frequency has not been directly explored. Hence the general idea of this work is to address this by modeling wave propagation in a generic pulsatile system through a fluid-structure interaction solver (based on a reduced-order Navier-Stokes formulation) applied to a fluid-filled compliant tube terminated by a controlled reflection site. We analyze the impact of reflection on such pulse waves and their associated power-frequency relationships. Our analysis considers moderate frequencies and large wavelengths as inspired by cardiovascular flows. Examining pressure-flow dynamics reveals two distinct regimes as a function of inflow frequency: a pressure-leading regime and a flow-leading regime. We observe that the latter transitions into the former at particular “optimum frequencies” that minimize the pulsatile load on the inlet and create nonlinearity in power-frequency patterns. Results suggest that the values of these frequencies strongly depend on the reflection coefficient of the tube. Our findings highlight the significance of reflection as a key determinant in design that can provide control of optimum inflow frequencies toward minimizing destructive pulsatile loads.},

  abstract    = {Analyzing cardiac pulse waveforms offers valuable insights into heart health and cardiovascular disease risk, although obtaining the more informative measurements from the central aorta remains challenging due to their invasive nature and limited noninvasive options. To address this, we employed a laboratory-developed cuff device for high-resolution pulse waveform acquisition and constructed a spectral machine learning model to nonlinearly map the brachial wave components to the aortic site. Simultaneous invasive aortic catheter and brachial cuff waveforms were acquired in 115 subjects to evaluate the clinical performance of the developed wave-based approach. Magnitude, shape, and pulse waveform analysis on the measured and reconstructed aortic waveforms were correlated on a beat-to-beat basis. The proposed cuff-based method reconstructed aortic waveform contours with high fidelity (mean normalized-RMS error = 11.3%). Furthermore, continuous signal reconstruction captured dynamic aortic systolic blood pressure (BP) oscillations (r = 0.76, P < 0.05). Method-derived central pressures showed strong correlation with the independent invasive measurement for systolic BP (R2 = 0.83; B [LOA] = −0.3 [−17.0, 16.4] mmHg) and diastolic BP (R2 = 0.58; B [LOA] = −0.7 [−13.1, 11.6] mmHg). Shape-based features are effectively captured by the spectral machine learning method, showing strong correlations and no systemic bias for systolic pressure–time integral (r = 0.91, P < 0.05), diastolic pressure–time integral (r = 0.95, P < 0.05), and subendocardial viability ratio (r = 0.86, P < 0.05). These results suggest that the nonlinear transformation of wave components from the distal to the central site predicts the morphological waveform changes resulting from complex wave propagation and reflection within the cardiovascular network. The proposed wave-based approach holds promise for future applications of noninvasive devices in clinical cardiology.},

  abstract    = {Age-related changes in aortic biomechanics can impact the brain by reducing blood flow and increasing pulsatile energy transmission. Clinical studies have shown that impaired cardiac function in patients with heart failure is associated with cognitive impairment. Although previous studies have attempted to elucidate the complex relationship between age-associated aortic stiffening and pulsatility transmission to the cerebral network, they have not adequately addressed the effect of interactions between aortic stiffness and left ventricle (LV) contractility (neither on energy transmission nor on brain perfusion). In this study, we use a well-established and validated one-dimensional blood flow and pulse wave computational model of the circulatory system to address how age-related changes in cardiac function and vasculature affect the underlying mechanisms involved in the LV-aorta-brain hemodynamic coupling. Our results reveal how LV contractility affects pulsatile energy transmission to the brain, even with preserved cardiac output. Our model demonstrates the existence of an optimal heart rate (near the normal human heart rate) that minimizes pulsatile energy transmission to the brain at different contractility levels. Our findings further suggest that the reduction in cerebral blood flow at low levels of LV contractility is more prominent in the setting of age-related aortic stiffening. Maintaining optimal blood flow to the brain requires either an increase in contractility or an increase in heart rate. The former consistently leads to higher pulsatile power transmission, and the latter can either increase or decrease subsequent pulsatile power transmission to the brain.},

  abstract    = {Detection and analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have emerged as a promising way to diagnose cancer, study its cellular mechanism, and test or develop potential treatments. However, the rarity of CTCs among peripheral blood cells is a big challenge toward CTC detection. In addition, in cases where there is similar size range between certain types of CTCs (e.g. breast cancer cells) and white blood cells (WBCs), high-resolution techniques are needed. In the present work, we propose a deterministic dielectrophoresis (DEP) method that combines the concept of deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) and insulator-based dielectrophoresis (iDEP) techniques that rely on physical markers such as size and dielectric properties to differentiate different type of cells. The proposed deterministic DEP technology takes advantage of frequency-controlled AC electric field for continuous separation of CTCs from peripheral blood cells. Utilizing numerical modeling, different aspects of coupled DLD-DEP design such as the required applied voltages, velocities, and geometrical parameters of DLD arrays of microposts are investigated. Regarding the inevitable difference and uncertainty ranges for the reported crossover frequencies of cells, a comprehensive analysis is conducted on applied electric field frequency as design's determinant factor. Deterministic DEP design provides continuous sorting of CTCs from WBCs even with similar size and has the future potential for high throughput and efficiency.}

  abstract    = {Recent progress in the development of biosensors has created a demand for high-throughput sample preparation techniques that can be easily integrated into microfluidic or lab-on-a-chip platforms. One mechanism that may satisfy this demand is deterministic lateral displacement (DLD), which uses hydrodynamic forces to separate particles based on size. Numerous medically relevant cellular organisms, such as circulating tumor cells (10–15 µm) and red blood cells (6–8 µm), can be manipulated using microscale DLD devices. In general, these often-viscous samples require some form of dilution or other treatment prior to microfluidic transport, further increasing the need for high-throughput operation to compensate for the increased sample volume. However, high-throughput DLD devices will require a high flow rate, leading to an increase in Reynolds numbers (Re) much higher than those covered by existing studies for microscale (≤ 100 µm) DLD devices. This study characterizes the separation performance for microscale DLD devices in the high-Re regime (10 < Re < 60) through numerical simulation and experimental validation. As Re increases, streamlines evolve and microvortices emerge in the wake of the pillars, resulting in a particle trajectory shift within the DLD array. This differs from previous DLD works, in that traditional models only account for streamlines that are characteristic of low-Re flow, with no consideration for the transformation of these streamlines with increasing Re. We have established a trend through numerical modeling, which agrees with our experimental findings, to serve as a guideline for microscale DLD performance in the high-Re regime. Finally, this new phenomenon could be exploited to design passive DLD devices with a dynamic separation range, controlled simply by adjusting the device flow rate.}

  abstract    = {One essential step in biosample analysis is the purification, separation, or fractionation of a biofluid prior to transport to the biosensor. Deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) has demonstrated the potential for continuous size-based separation of numerous medically relevant particles and organisms, such as circulating tumor cells, red blood cells, and even viral particles. Recently, high-throughput DLD separation has been demonstrated by utilizing higher flow rates, but this also results in changing separation dynamics as the Reynolds number (Re) increases. It has been observed that the critical diameter (Dc) for a DLD device decreases as Re climbs, and theorized that both streamline compression and vortex emergence may contribute to this phenomenon. The precise mechanism for this shift has been difficult to isolate, however, due to the coupled nature of vortex emergence and streamline compression in high-Re DLD devices with circular pillars. To decouple these effects, we have characterized the performance of a DLD device with symmetric airfoil pillars that do not produce vortices up to Re = 100. In demonstrating a complete particle trajectory shift at Re = 51, we have shown that vortex effects are not a predominant contributor to this Dc shift, thus streamline evolution is likely to be the primary mechanism. Furthermore, we have compared the performance of this device to a similar device with rotated pillars having a negative 15° angle of attack, and found that separation effectiveness declines as streamlines become highly asymmetric and small particles exhibit significant variation in their trajectories.}

  abstract    = {Deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) is a common name given to a class of continuous microfluidic separation devices that use a repeating array of pillars to selectively displace particles having a mean diameter greater than the critical diameter (Dc). This Dc is an emergent property influenced by pillar shape, size, and spacing, in addition to the suspending fluid and target particle properties. The majority of previous research in DLD applications has focused on the utilization of laminar flow in low Reynolds number (Re) regimes. While laminar flow exhibits uniform streamlines and predictable separation characteristics, this low-Re regime is dependent on relatively low fluid velocities, and may not hold true at higher processing speeds. Through numerical modeling and experimentation, we investigated high-Re flow characteristics and potential separation enhancements resulting from vortex generation within a DLD array. We used an analytical model and computational software to simulate DLD performance spanning a Re range of 1–100 at flow rates of 2–170 μL/s (0.15–10 mL/min). Each simulated DLD array configuration was composed of 60 μm cylindrical pillars with a 45 μm gap size. The experimental DLD device was fabricated using conventional soft lithography, and injected with 20 μm particles at varying flow rates to observe particle trajectories. The simulated results predict a shift in Dc at Re > 50, while the experimental results indicate a breakdown of typical DLD operation at Re > 70.}

In this research, we utilized numerical simulation to study, in detail, insulating posts iDEP technique with the specific application of bioparticles separation. To achieve this, we first developed a robust numerical model to predict the electric and fluid flow fields’ distribution, and how bioparticles are being manipulated inside the system. This enabled us to study the fundamental principles of such an iDEP method. In the next step, different design aspects of insulating posts iDEP were investigated. Specifically, we focused on the effect of posts geometry and configuration on the systems’ key operation criteria such as the effectiveness of the electric field non-uniformity, the flow velocity distribution and shear stress rates. Furthermore, we studied how different electrodes’ setup may affect the electric field distribution and consequently the device performance.

A robust numerical model is developed to calculate the distribution of electric and fluid flow fields in the presence of JH and ET flow, and predict the cells’ trajectory inside the system. Our results indicate that JH not only induces temperature rise in the system, but also may alter the design iDEP separation scenario by inducing ET vortices that affect the cell's trajectory. To investigate the impact of JH-induced ET flow characteristics and vortex generation on separation efficiency, we introduce a dimensionless force ratio encompassing the effects of electrical field, drag forces, JH, and ET flow. Interestingly, it was found that ET flows can be used to significantly enhance the separation efficiency, even in higher inlet flow rates. Lastly, the effect of post geometry has been discussed.}

Growing interest in utilizing high-throughput DLD devices for practical applications, such as circulating tumor cell separation, necessitates employing higher flow rates in these devices, leading to operating in moderate to high Reynolds number (Re) regimes. Despite extensive research on DLD devices in the creeping regime, limited research has focused on the physics of flow, critical size of the device, and deformable cell behavior in DLD devices at moderate to high Re. In this study, the transport behavior of particles/cells is investigated in realistic high-throughput DLD devices with hundreds of microposts by utilizing multiphysics modeling. A practical formula is proposed for the prediction of the device critical size, which could serve as a design guideline for high-throughput DLD devices. Then, the complex hydrodynamic interactions between a deformable cell and DLD post arrays are investigated. A dimensionless index is utilized for comparing different post designs to quantify the cell–post interaction. It is shown that the separation performances in high-throughput devices are highly affected by Re as well as the micropost shapes. These findings can be utilized for the design and optimization of high-throughput DLD microfluidic devices.}

  author      = {Kang, Jingyi and Aghilinejad, Arian and Pahlevan, Niema M.},
  abstract    = {Recent studies showed that wave intensity analysis (WIA) provides clinically valuable information about local and global cardiovascular function. Wave intensity (WI) is computed as the product of the pressure change and the velocity change during short time intervals. The major limitation of WIA in clinical practice is the need for invasive pressure measurement. Since vessel wall displacement can be measured non-invasively, the usage of WI will be expanded if the vessel wall dilation is used instead of pressure in derivation of WI waveform. Our goal in this study is to investigate the agreement between wall displacement-based WI and the pressure-based WI for different vessel wall models including linear elastic, nonlinear and viscoelastic cases. The arbitrary Eulerian Lagrangian finite element method is employed to solve the coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI). Our computational models also include two types of vascular disease-related cases with geometrical irregularities, aneurysm and stenosis. Our results show that for vessels with linear elastic wall, the displacement-based WI is almost identical to the pressure-based WI. The existence of vessel irregularities does not impact the accuracy of displacement-based WI. However, in a viscoelastic wall where there is a phase difference between pressure and vessel wall dilation, displacement-based WI deviated from pressure-based WI. The error associated with this phase difference increased nonlinearly with increasing viscosity. This results in a maximum error of 6.8% and 7.13% for a regular viscoelastic vessel wall and an irregular viscoelastic vessel wall, respectively. A separate analysis has also been performed on the agreement of backward and forward running waves extracted from a decomposition of the displacement-based and pressure-based WI. Our findings suggest that displacement-based WI is a reliable method of WIA for large central arteries that do not show viscoelastic behaviors. This can be clinically significant since the required information can be measured non-invasively.}

  abstract    = {Cancer is among a major health concerns all over the world. Cancer metastasis, which defines as the migration of malignant cells from original sites to distant organs, is the main reason of death due to cancer and there is growing evidence that Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) are responsible for initiating the metastasis. Due to the importance of these bioparticles in biotechnology and medicine, there is a growing interest to study and separate them through different techniques especially microfluidic label-free technologies. One such technology, termed Deterministic Lateral Displacement (DLD) has recently shown promising abilities to separate cells and particles of different sizes. However, DLD is a separation method that takes advantages of the predictable flow laminae of low Reynolds number (Re) fluid flow. In order to achieve higher device throughput, effects of higher Reynolds number flow on DLD device should be studied. Additionally, the higher flow rates would apply higher forces and shear stresses on the cells which threaten the cell’s viability. In this study, employing numerical simulation, the effect of high Re number on DLD device for separating cancer cells has been investigated. Specifically, we conducted force analysis and by focusing on the downstream gap distance between the posts, we improved the device which results in less cell deformation. Our developed numerical model and presented results lay the groundwork for design and fabrication of high-throughput DLD microchips for enhanced separation of CTCs.}

  abstract    = {Aortic stiffness increases with age and is a robust predictor of brain pathology including Alzheimer’s and other dementias. Aging causes disproportionate stiffening of the aorta compared with the carotid arteries, reducing protective impedance mismatches at their interface and affecting transmission of destructive pulsatile energy to the cerebral circulation. Recent clinical studies have measured regional stiffness within the aortic arch using pulse wave velocity (PWV) and have found a stronger association with cerebrovascular events than global stiffness measures. However, effects of aortic arch PWV on the transmission of harmful excessive pulsatile energy to the brain is not well-understood. In this study, we use an energy-based analysis of hemodynamic waves to quantify the effect of aortic arch stiffening on transmitted pulsatility to cerebral vasculature, employing a computational approach using a one-dimensional model of the human vascular network. Results show there exists an optimum wave condition—occurring near normal human heart rates—that minimizes pulsatile energy transmission to the brain. This indicates the important role of aortic arch biomechanics on heart-brain coupling. Our results also suggest that energy-based indices of pulsatility combining pressure and flow data are more sensitive to increased stiffness than using flow or pressure pulsatility indices in isolation.}

  abstract    = {Advances in microfluidics inaugurate a new possibility of designing diagnostic devices for early cancer detection. There is a growing interest in deformation-based microfiltration for capturing circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from peripheral blood due to its simplicity and low cost. Fundamental understanding of CTC passing through a microfilter is critical, as it helps optimize the design for achieving high isolation purity. Previous research has modeled CTC as a simple droplet for deformation-based CTC separation. Here, we use a compound droplet model to study the flow dynamics more realistically. An adaptive-mesh-refinement (AMR) method is used here, using the open-source code, gerris, after modification for droplet dynamics and contact angle model. The developed code is validated with results compared with ansysfluent and available theory. The effects of various parameters such as the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio, operating flow rate, and cell viscosity are investigated. It is found that the compound droplet behaves like a homogeneous droplet when the nucleus size is smaller than the filtering channel. However, the pressure profile is greatly influenced by the nucleus when it is larger than the channel size. In addition, there is a linear correlation between the pressure drop in the channel and the operating flow rate. Similarly, critical passing pressure increases linearly with the increase of the cell viscosity. Our study suggests that for having an accurate prediction of cell transport behavior inside the microchannel, it is of great importance to consider the effects of the nucleus and its possible deformation.}

  abstract    = {Background. Wave intensity (WI) analysis is a well-established method for quantifying the energy carried in arterial waves, providing valuable clinical information about cardiovascular function. The primary drawback of this method is the need for concurrent measurements of both pressure and flow waveforms. Objective. We have for the first time investigated the accuracy of a novel methodology for estimating wave intensity employing only single pressure waveform measurements; we studied both carotid- and radial-based estimations in a large heterogeneous cohort. Approach. Tonometry was performed alongside Doppler ultrasound to acquire measurements of both carotid and radial pressure waveforms as well as aortic flow waveforms in 2640 healthy and diseased participants (1439 female) in the Framingham Heart Study. Patterns consisting of two forward waves (Wf1, Wf2) and one backward wave (Wb1) along with reflection metrics were compared with those obtained from exact WI analysis. Main Results. Carotid-based estimates correlated well for forward peak amplitudes (Wf1,  = 0.85,  < 0.05; Wf2,  = 0.72,  < 0.05) and peak time (Wf1,  = 0.94,  < 0.05; Wf2,  = 0.98,  < 0.05), and radial-based estimates correlated fairly to poorly for amplitudes (Wf1,  = 0.62,  < 0.05; Wf2,  = 0.42,  < 0.05) and peak time (Wf1,  = 0.04,  = 0.10; Wf2,  = 0.75, < 0.05). In all cases, estimated Wb1 measures were not correlated. Reflection metrics were well correlated for healthy patients ( = 0.67, < 0.05), moderately correlated for valvular disease ( = 0.59,  < 0.05) and fairly correlated for CVD ( = 0.46,  < 0.05) and heart failure ( = 0.49,  < 0.05). Significance. These findings indicate that pressure-only WI produces accurate results only when forward contributions are of primary interest and only for carotid pressure waveforms. The pressure-only WI estimations of this work provide an important opportunity to further the goal of uncovering clinical insights through wave analysis affordably and non-invasively.}

  abstract    = {Intrinsic Frequency (IF) is a systems-based approach that provides valuable information for hemodynamic monitoring of the left ventricle (LV), the arterial system, and their coupling. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated the clinical significance of this method for prognosis and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. In IF analysis, two dominant instantaneous frequencies ( and ) are extracted from arterial pressure waveforms. The value of  is related to the dynamics of the LV and the value of  is related to the dynamics of vascular function. This work investigates the effects of vessel wall mechanics on the accuracy and applicability of IFs extracted from vessel wall displacement waveforms compared to IFs extracted from pressure waveforms. In this study, we used a computational approach employing a fluid–structure interaction finite element method for various wall mechanics governed by linearly elastic, hyperelastic, and viscoelastic models. Results show that for vessels with elastic wall behavior, the error between displacement-based and pressure-based IFs is negligible. In the presence of stenosis or aneurysm in elastic arteries, the maximum errors associated with displacement-based IFs is less than 2%. For non-linear elastic and viscoelastic arteries, errors are more pronounced (where the former reaches up to 11% and the latter up to 27%). Our results ultimately suggest that displacement-based computations of  and are accurate in vessels that exhibit elastic behavior (such as carotid arteries) and are suitable surrogates for pressure-based IFs. This is clinically significant because displacement-based IFs can be measured non-invasively.}

  abstract    = {In-vitro models of the systemic circulation have gained a lot of interest for fundamental understanding of cardiovascular dynamics and for applied hemodynamic research. In this study, we introduce a physiologically accurate in-vitro hydraulic setup that models the hemodynamics of the coupled atrioventricular-aortic system. This unique experimental simulator has three major components: 1) an arterial system consisting of a human-scale artificial aorta along with the main branches, 2) an artificial left ventricle (LV) sac connected to a programmable piston-in-cylinder pump for simulating cardiac contraction and relaxation, and 3) an artificial left atrium (LA). The setup is designed in such a way that the basal LV is directly connected to the aortic root via an aortic valve, and to the LA via an artificial mitral valve. As a result, two-way hemodynamic couplings can be achieved for studying the effects that the LV, aorta, and LA have on each other. The collected pressure and flow measurements from this setup demonstrate a remarkable correspondence to clinical hemodynamics. We also investigate the physiological relevancies of isolated effects on cardiovascular hemodynamics of various major global parameters found in the circulatory system, including LV contractility, LV preload, heart rate, aortic compliance, and peripheral resistance. Subsequent control over such parameters ultimately captures physiological hemodynamic effects of LV systolic dysfunction, preload (cardiac) diseases, and afterload (arterial) diseases. The detailed design and fabrication of the proposed setup is also provided.}

  abstract    = {Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is a commonly performed operation for patients with type B aortic dissection (TBAD). The goal of TEVAR is to cover the proximal entry tear between the true lumen (TL) and the false lumen (FL) with an endograft to induce FL thrombosis, allow for aortic healing, and decrease the risk of aortic aneurysm and rupture. While TEVAR has shown promising outcomes, it can also result in devastating complications including stroke, spinal cord ischemia resulting in paralysis, as well as long-term heart failure, so treatment remains controversial. Similarly, the biomechanical impact of aortic endograft implantation and the hemodynamic impact of endograft design parameters such as length are not well-understood. In this study, a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach was used based on the immersed boundary and Lattice–Boltzmann method to investigate the association between the endograft length and hemodynamic variables inside the TL and FL. The physiological accuracy of the model was evaluated by comparing simulation results with the true pressure waveform measurements taken during a live TEVAR operation for TBAD. The results demonstrate a non-linear trend towards increased FL flow reversal as the endograft length increases but also increased left ventricular pulsatile workload. These findings suggest a medium-length endograft may be optimal by achieving FL flow reversal and thus FL thrombosis, while minimizing the extra load on the left ventricle. These results also verify that a reduction in heart rate with medical therapy contributes favorably to FL flow reversal.}

  abstract    = {Objective: The clinical significance of the wave intensity (WI) analysis for the diagnosis and prognosis of the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases is well-established. However, this method has not been fully translated into clinical practice. From practical point of view, the main limitation of WI method is the need for concurrent measurements of both pressure and flow waveforms. To overcome this limitation, we developed a Fourier-based machine learning (F-ML) approach to evaluate WI using only the pressure waveform measurement. Methods: Tonometry recordings of the carotid pressure and ultrasound measurements for the aortic flow waveforms from the Framingham Heart Study (2640 individuals; 55% women) were used for developing the F-ML model and the blind testing. Results: Method-derived estimates are significantly correlated for the first and second forward wave peak amplitudes (Wf1, r = 0.88, p < 0.05; Wf2, r = 0.84, p < 0.05) and the corresponding peak times (Wf1, r = 0.80, p < 0.05; Wf2, r = 0.97, p < 0.05). For backward components of WI (Wb1), F-ML estimates correlated strongly for the amplitude (r = 0.71, p < 0.05) and moderately for the peak time (r = 0.60, p < 0.05). The results show that the pressure-only F-ML model significantly outperforms the analytical pressure-only approach based on the reservoir model. In all cases, the Bland-Altman analysis shows negligible bias in the estimations. Conclusion: The proposed pressure-only F-ML approach provides accurate estimates for WI parameters. Significance: The pressure only F-ML approach introduced in this work expand the clinical usage of WI into inexpensive and non-invasive settings such as wearable telemedicine.}

Due to the complexity of patient-specific characteristics, only limited information on flow patterns in dissected aortas has been reported in the literature. Leveraging the medical imaging data for patient-specific in vitro modeling can complement the hemodynamic understanding of aortic dissections. We propose a new approach toward fully automated patient-specific type B aortic dissection model fabrication. Our framework uses a novel deep-learning-based segmentation for negative mold manufacturing. Deep-learning architectures were trained on a dataset of 15 unique computed tomography scans of dissection subjects and were blind-tested on 4 sets of scans, which were targeted for fabrication. Following segmentation, the three-dimensional models were created and printed using polyvinyl alcohol. These models were then coated with latex to create compliant patient-specific phantom models. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) structural images demonstrate the ability of the introduced manufacturing technique for creating intimal septum walls and tears based on patient-specific anatomy. The in vitro experiments show the fabricated phantoms generate physiologically-accurate pressure results. The deep-learning models also show high similarity metrics between manual segmentation and autosegmentation where Dice metric is as high as 0.86. The proposed deep-learning-based negative mold manufacturing method facilitates an inexpensive, reproducible, and physiologically-accurate patient-specific phantom model fabrication suitable for aortic dissection flow modeling.}

  abstract    = {This study investigates the physics of the longitudinal stretching-based wave pumping mechanism, a novel extension of the traditional impedance pump. In its simplest form, an impedance pump consists of a fluid-filled elastic tube connected to rigid tubes with a wave generator. These valveless pumps operate based on the principles of wave propagation in a fluid-filled compliant tube. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging of the human circulatory system has shown substantial stretching of the aorta (the largest compliant artery of the body carrying blood) during the heart contraction and recoil of the aorta during the relaxation. Inspired by this dynamic mechanism, a comprehensive analysis of a longitudinal impedance pump is conducted in this study where waves are generated by stretching of the elastic wall and its recoil. We developed a fully coupled fluid–structure interaction computational model consisting of a straight fluid-filled elastic tube with longitudinal stretch at one end and a fixed reflection site at the other end. The pump's behavior is quantified as a function of stretching frequency and tube wall characteristics. Our results indicate that stretch-related wave propagation and reflection can induce frequency-dependent pumping. Findings suggest a non-linear pattern for the mean flow–frequency relationship. Based on the analysis of the propagated waveforms, the underlying physical mechanism in the longitudinal impedance pump is discussed. It is shown that both the direction and magnitude of the net flow strongly depend on the wave characteristics. These findings provide a fundamental understanding of stretch-related wave pumping and can inform the future design of such pumps.}

  abstract    = {Aims: The ageing process notably induces structural changes in the arterial system, primarily manifesting as increased aortic stiffness, a precursor to cardiovascular events. While wave separation analysis is a robust tool for decomposing the components of blood pressure waveform, its relationship with cardiovascular events, such as aortic stiffening, is incompletely understood. Furthermore, its applicability has been limited due to the need for concurrent measurements of pressure and flow. Our aim in this study addresses this gap by introducing a spectral regression learning method for pressure-only wave separation analysis. Methods and results:Leveraging data from the Framingham Heart Study (2640 individuals, 55% women), we evaluate the accuracy of pressure-only estimates, their interchangeability with a reference method based on ultrasound-derived flow waves, and their association with carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV). Method-derived estimates are strongly correlated with the reference ones for forward wave amplitude (⁠⁠), backward wave amplitude (⁠⁠), and reflection index (⁠⁠) and moderately correlated with a time delay between forward and backward waves (⁠⁠). The proposed pressure-only method shows interchangeability with the reference method through covariate analysis. Adjusting for age, sex, body size, mean blood pressure, and heart rate, the results suggest that both pressure-only and pressure-flow evaluations of wave separation parameters yield similar model performances for predicting carotid-femoral PWV, with forward wave amplitude being the only significant factor (P < 0.001; 95% confidence interval, 0.056–0.097). Conclusion: We propose an interchangeable pressure-only wave separation analysis method and demonstrate its clinical applicability in capturing aortic stiffening.

To assess the central aortic pressure using radial-based measurements, there is an essential need to develop mathematical approaches to estimate the central pressure waveform. In this study, we propose a new Fourier-based machine learning (F-ML) methodology to transfer non-invasive radial pressure measurements to the central pressure waveform. To test the method, collection of tonometry recordings of the radial and carotid pressure measurements are used from the Framingham Heart Study (2640 individuals, 55 % women) with mean (range) age of 66 (40–91) years. Method-derived estimates are significantly correlated with the measured ones for three major features of the pressure waveform (systolic blood pressure, =0.97, p < 0.001; diastolic blood pressure, =0.99, p < 0.001; and mean blood pressure, =0.99, p < 0.001). In all cases, the Bland-Altman analysis shows negligible bias in the estimations and error is bounded to 5.4 mmHg. Findings also suggest that the F-ML approach reconstructs the shape of the central pressure waveform accurately with the average normalized root mean square error of 5.5 % in the testing population which is blinded to all stages of machine learning development. The results show that the F-ML transfer function outperforms the conventional generalized transfer function, particularly in terms of reconstructing the shape of the central pressure waveform morphology. The proposed F-ML transfer function can provide accurate estimates for the central pressure waveform, and ultimately expand the usage of non-invasive devices for central hemodynamic assessment.}
