  abstract    = {Wave propagation in the heart tube is key to establishing an early pumping mechanism, as explained by impedance pump theory in zebrafish. Though initially proposed for embryonic blood circulation, the role of impedance-like behaviour in the mature cardiovascular system remains unclear. This study focuses on the understudied physiological mechanism of longitudinal displacement in the adult aorta caused by the long-axis motion of the heart. Using magnetic resonance imaging on 159 individuals, we compared aortic displacement profiles between a control group and those with heart failure, revealing a significant difference in aortic stretch between the two groups. Building on this clinical evidence, we conducted in vitro experiments to isolate the effects of longitudinal aortic wave pumping by eliminating the pumping action of the heart. We identified three biomechanical properties of stretch-related longitudinal wave pumping that exhibit characteristics like impedance pump: (i) a nonlinear flow–frequency relationship, (ii) bidirectional flow, and (iii) the potential for both positive and negative flow at a fixed frequency, contingent upon the aorta’s wave speed dictating the wave state. Our results demonstrate for the first time that this mechanism generates a significant flow, potentially providing a supplementary pumping mechanism for the heart.},

  author      = {Aghilinejad, Arian and Amlani, Faisal and Gharib, Morteza},
  abstract    = {The human heart pumps in a pulsatile fashion that generates pressure and flow waves in the cardiovascular system. These waves propagate and reflect through a fractal tree network composed of fluid-filled compliant tubes. The resulting complex pressure and flow waves create a pulsatile workload (an important contributor to the pumping efficiency of the heart). Although such load has been shown to be dependent on inflow wave frequency, the fundamental relationship between power and frequency has not been directly explored. Hence the general idea of this work is to address this by modeling wave propagation in a generic pulsatile system through a fluid-structure interaction solver (based on a reduced-order Navier-Stokes formulation) applied to a fluid-filled compliant tube terminated by a controlled reflection site. We analyze the impact of reflection on such pulse waves and their associated power-frequency relationships. Our analysis considers moderate frequencies and large wavelengths as inspired by cardiovascular flows. Examining pressure-flow dynamics reveals two distinct regimes as a function of inflow frequency: a pressure-leading regime and a flow-leading regime. We observe that the latter transitions into the former at particular “optimum frequencies” that minimize the pulsatile load on the inlet and create nonlinearity in power-frequency patterns. Results suggest that the values of these frequencies strongly depend on the reflection coefficient of the tube. Our findings highlight the significance of reflection as a key determinant in design that can provide control of optimum inflow frequencies toward minimizing destructive pulsatile loads.},

  author      = {Tamborini, Alessio and Aghilinejad, Arian and Gharib, Morteza},
  abstract    = {Analyzing cardiac pulse waveforms offers valuable insights into heart health and cardiovascular disease risk, although obtaining the more informative measurements from the central aorta remains challenging due to their invasive nature and limited noninvasive options. To address this, we employed a laboratory-developed cuff device for high-resolution pulse waveform acquisition and constructed a spectral machine learning model to nonlinearly map the brachial wave components to the aortic site. Simultaneous invasive aortic catheter and brachial cuff waveforms were acquired in 115 subjects to evaluate the clinical performance of the developed wave-based approach. Magnitude, shape, and pulse waveform analysis on the measured and reconstructed aortic waveforms were correlated on a beat-to-beat basis. The proposed cuff-based method reconstructed aortic waveform contours with high fidelity (mean normalized-RMS error = 11.3%). Furthermore, continuous signal reconstruction captured dynamic aortic systolic blood pressure (BP) oscillations (r = 0.76, P < 0.05). Method-derived central pressures showed strong correlation with the independent invasive measurement for systolic BP (R2 = 0.83; B [LOA] = −0.3 [−17.0, 16.4] mmHg) and diastolic BP (R2 = 0.58; B [LOA] = −0.7 [−13.1, 11.6] mmHg). Shape-based features are effectively captured by the spectral machine learning method, showing strong correlations and no systemic bias for systolic pressure–time integral (r = 0.91, P < 0.05), diastolic pressure–time integral (r = 0.95, P < 0.05), and subendocardial viability ratio (r = 0.86, P < 0.05). These results suggest that the nonlinear transformation of wave components from the distal to the central site predicts the morphological waveform changes resulting from complex wave propagation and reflection within the cardiovascular network. The proposed wave-based approach holds promise for future applications of noninvasive devices in clinical cardiology.},

  abstract    = {Age-related changes in aortic biomechanics can impact the brain by reducing blood flow and increasing pulsatile energy transmission. Clinical studies have shown that impaired cardiac function in patients with heart failure is associated with cognitive impairment. Although previous studies have attempted to elucidate the complex relationship between age-associated aortic stiffening and pulsatility transmission to the cerebral network, they have not adequately addressed the effect of interactions between aortic stiffness and left ventricle (LV) contractility (neither on energy transmission nor on brain perfusion). In this study, we use a well-established and validated one-dimensional blood flow and pulse wave computational model of the circulatory system to address how age-related changes in cardiac function and vasculature affect the underlying mechanisms involved in the LV-aorta-brain hemodynamic coupling. Our results reveal how LV contractility affects pulsatile energy transmission to the brain, even with preserved cardiac output. Our model demonstrates the existence of an optimal heart rate (near the normal human heart rate) that minimizes pulsatile energy transmission to the brain at different contractility levels. Our findings further suggest that the reduction in cerebral blood flow at low levels of LV contractility is more prominent in the setting of age-related aortic stiffening. Maintaining optimal blood flow to the brain requires either an increase in contractility or an increase in heart rate. The former consistently leads to higher pulsatile power transmission, and the latter can either increase or decrease subsequent pulsatile power transmission to the brain.},

  author      = {Aghaamoo, Mohammad and Aghilinejad, Arian and Chen, Xiaolin and Xu, Jie},
  abstract    = {Detection and analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have emerged as a promising way to diagnose cancer, study its cellular mechanism, and test or develop potential treatments. However, the rarity of CTCs among peripheral blood cells is a big challenge toward CTC detection. In addition, in cases where there is similar size range between certain types of CTCs (e.g. breast cancer cells) and white blood cells (WBCs), high-resolution techniques are needed. In the present work, we propose a deterministic dielectrophoresis (DEP) method that combines the concept of deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) and insulator-based dielectrophoresis (iDEP) techniques that rely on physical markers such as size and dielectric properties to differentiate different type of cells. The proposed deterministic DEP technology takes advantage of frequency-controlled AC electric field for continuous separation of CTCs from peripheral blood cells. Utilizing numerical modeling, different aspects of coupled DLD-DEP design such as the required applied voltages, velocities, and geometrical parameters of DLD arrays of microposts are investigated. Regarding the inevitable difference and uncertainty ranges for the reported crossover frequencies of cells, a comprehensive analysis is conducted on applied electric field frequency as design's determinant factor. Deterministic DEP design provides continuous sorting of CTCs from WBCs even with similar size and has the future potential for high throughput and efficiency.}

  author      = {Dincau, Brian M. and Aghilinejad, Arian and Hammersley, Taylor and Chen, Xiaolin and Kim, Jong-Hoon},
  abstract    = {Recent progress in the development of biosensors has created a demand for high-throughput sample preparation techniques that can be easily integrated into microfluidic or lab-on-a-chip platforms. One mechanism that may satisfy this demand is deterministic lateral displacement (DLD), which uses hydrodynamic forces to separate particles based on size. Numerous medically relevant cellular organisms, such as circulating tumor cells (10–15 µm) and red blood cells (6–8 µm), can be manipulated using microscale DLD devices. In general, these often-viscous samples require some form of dilution or other treatment prior to microfluidic transport, further increasing the need for high-throughput operation to compensate for the increased sample volume. However, high-throughput DLD devices will require a high flow rate, leading to an increase in Reynolds numbers (Re) much higher than those covered by existing studies for microscale (≤ 100 µm) DLD devices. This study characterizes the separation performance for microscale DLD devices in the high-Re regime (10 < Re < 60) through numerical simulation and experimental validation. As Re increases, streamlines evolve and microvortices emerge in the wake of the pillars, resulting in a particle trajectory shift within the DLD array. This differs from previous DLD works, in that traditional models only account for streamlines that are characteristic of low-Re flow, with no consideration for the transformation of these streamlines with increasing Re. We have established a trend through numerical modeling, which agrees with our experimental findings, to serve as a guideline for microscale DLD performance in the high-Re regime. Finally, this new phenomenon could be exploited to design passive DLD devices with a dynamic separation range, controlled simply by adjusting the device flow rate.}

  abstract    = {Insulator-based dielectrophoresis (iDEP) is a powerful technique for separation and manipulation of bioparticles. In recent years, iDEP designs using arrays of insulating posts have shown promising results toward reaching high-efficiency bioparticle manipulation. Joule heating (JH) and electrothermal (ET) flows have been observed in iDEP microdevices and significantly affecting their performances. In this research, we utilize mathematical modeling to study, iDEP technique and the effects of JH and ET flow on device performance and propose a separation scenario for selective trapping of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). A robust numerical model is developed to calculate the distribution of electric and fluid flow fields in the presence of JH and ET flow, and predict the cells’ trajectory inside the system. Our results indicate that JH not only induces temperature rise in the system, but also may alter the design iDEP separation scenario by inducing ET vortices that affect the cell's trajectory. To investigate the impact of JH-induced ET flow characteristics and vortex generation on separation efficiency, we introduce a dimensionless force ratio encompassing the effects of electrical field, drag forces, JH, and ET flow. Interestingly, it was found that ET flows can be used to significantly enhance the separation efficiency, even in higher inlet flow rates. Lastly, the effect of post geometry has been discussed.}
