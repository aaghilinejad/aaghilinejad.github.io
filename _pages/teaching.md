# **Longitudinal Impedance Pump**

This patent describes a system for generating unidirectional flow using asymmetric impedance boundaries along a fluid-filled conduit. The design leverages wave reflections and impedance mismatch to create flow without any moving parts, making it suitable for microscale and biomedical applications where traditional pumps are impractical.

# **Method for Transferring a Pressure Wave from Peripheral Site to Central Site**

This patent outlines a computational method for estimating central aortic pressure waveforms based on peripheral (e.g., brachial) pressure recordings. The technique uses signal processing and model-based transformations to reconstruct central waveforms, enabling non-invasive cardiovascular diagnostics with enhanced accuracy.
