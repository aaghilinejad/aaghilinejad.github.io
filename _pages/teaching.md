# **Longitudinal Impedance Pump**

Motivated by the wave-based flow mechanisms uncovered through my experimental and computational studies of the aorta, I developed a novel pumping technology inspired by the compliant, fluid-filled geometry of arterial vessels. This device—termed the longitudinal impedance pump—operates via cyclic axial stretching and passive recoil of an elastic tube, producing net flow through wave propagation and reflection during a cycle, without requiring valves or rotating parts.

# **Method for Transferring a Pressure Wave from Peripheral Site to Central Site**

This patent introduces a wave-based approach that combines brachial cuff measurements with machine learning to nonlinearly map brachial wave components to the aortic site, enabling accurate reconstruction of the central pressure waveform.
